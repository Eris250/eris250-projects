            Christians should be wary of the personality testing website called <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/" 
            class="highlight-test"> 16Personalities</a>. Essentially, the 16Personalities test sorts people into 16 personality 
            types based on the MBTI. What most people don't know about, though, is that it's made to encourage people to
            sin and rebel against God. In particular, the "Debater" is often drawn with strong devil motifs and with its 
            attractiveness played up. <span class="highlight-test">This is most likely a ploy to make the devil look desirable 
            and sexy, tempting people to sin.</span> Not only that, the website also teaches people that they can defy God's 
            will and passes it off as a good thing. <br><br>
