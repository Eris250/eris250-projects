            <h3>Part 1: Starting Out</h3>
            <p>
            Hello everyone! I decided to play Pokemon Platinum this time. I used to play Pokemon
            Platinum back when I was a kid and had good memories of it, but couldn't make it past
            the fifth gym. So I decided to replay the game after beating White 2. <br>
            </p>
            <img src="Images/Series/Pokemon Platinum/PokePlat1/Title Screen.jpg" alt="Pokemon Platinum title screen">
            <p>
            The title screen, featuring a neon Giratina. Anyways, let's just start the game.
            </p>
            <img src="Images/Series/Pokemon Platinum/PokePlat1/Welcome Speech.jpg" alt="This is a Pokemon ">
            <p>
            Ah, the welcome speech. Whenever you start a new game you always get a greeting from
            the Professor. I don't know if the newer games still kept this speech though. Either way,
            it always boils down to the same "Welcome to the Pokemon world, we live alongside Pokemon" 
            and asking your name and gender.
            </p>

            <p>
            "My name is Eris, and this is my friend Barry." <br>
            Rowan: "Oh, I see. Your journey has begun."
            </p>
            <img src="Images/Series/Pokemon Platinum/PokePlat1/waking up.jpg" alt="wakey wakey">
            <p>
            I was sleeping when I suddenly heard a familiar voice. 
            "There you are! Did you watch the TV? Oh yes you did!" It was Barry, my childhood friend.
            I would be shocked by that sudden appearance, but he had done this so many times it 
            didn't matter.
            <br> <br>
            Barry was energetic and very impatient. He was always excited over something, but 
            he was also very forgetful.
            <br> <br>
            I quickly got up from my bed. My hair was messy and I was still wearing my
            pajamas. As expected, Barry was full of energy.
            </p>
            <img src="Images/Series/Pokemon Platinum/PokePlat1/Barry HOW DID YOU GET INTO MY HOUSE.jpg" alt="Barry in house">
            <p>
            "Professor Rowan's that really important guy who studies Pokemon, right? That means
            he must have lots and lots of Pokemon! So, if we ask him, he can give us some Pokemon!"
            <br> <br>
            I was excited at the thought of getting my first Pokemon. Finally, I can go on my
            own journey, just like the older kids! I'm going to beat the Gym Leaders and- "Oh, 
            hey! Is that a new PC?" 
            <br> <br>
            I turned around to see Barry sitting in front of my computer. "Barry! No! There's a 
            lot of important files there!" I shouted at him.
            Barry quickly got up with an embarrassed look on his face. "Uh... now, where was I?
            Oh, right! We're going to see Professor Rowan and get some Pokemon!" Barry quickly
            realized. "I'll be waiting outside. OK, Eris? If you're late, I'm fining you ¥10
            million!"
            <br> <br>
            He then rushed out of the room. I'd better hurry. After all, this might be the 
            most important day of my life.
            <br> <br>
            I took a quick shower and changed clothes. I went downstairs and there was Mom, waiting.
            </p>
            <img src="Images/Series/Pokemon Platinum/PokePlat1/good morning ma.jpg" alt="Downstairs">
            <p>
            "Good morning, Eris! I fixed some of your favorite pancakes for you. Can't start 
            the day with an empty stomach!" Mom said. 
            But there's no time to wait. I want my Pokemon now! After all, it won't be long
            before I get back home.
            "I'm going to get my first Pokemon! Bye mom! I'll be back soon!" 
            I waved goodbye to her as I left my house. "Wait! But how about the-"
            <br> <br>
            Now, where's that bugger?
            <br> <br>
            I decided to go over to Barry's house. I knocked the door.
            <br> <br>
            Barry opened the door with a thud. "Now what was that about?" Barry shouted. "Oh yeah,
            I'm going to see Professor Rowan! You should come too! And quickly!"
            <br> <br>
            He took a few steps before going back inside his house. "Jeez! I forgot something!"
            A few minutes later, he stepped out of the door. "I'll be waiting on the road! It's a ¥10 million fine if
            you don't arrive there quickly!" He dashed away. 
            <br> <br>
            I followed Barry to Route 201, the only road leading out of our tiny town. The 
            Professor's lab was located at Sandgem Town, which was within walking distance
            of our town.
            </p>
            <img src="Images/Series/Pokemon Platinum/PokePlat1/Barry waiting on the road.jpg" alt="Route 201">
            <p>
            "Too slow! Alright, let's get moving to Professor Rowan's lab!" Barry exclaimed. 
            But a patch of tall grass stood in our way. There is no other way around it. Adults
            always tell kids to stay out of them, lest they get attacked by wild Pokemon living 
            in the tall grass. But I frankly don't get why Mom was so worried about it. Aw
            c'mon, they don't look that dangerous to me!
            <br> <br>
            I looked at my friend Barry. "Don't go into the grass, right? No worries! No problem!
            It doesn't matter that we don't have any Pokemon." He seemed to agree with me.
            <br> <br>
            "Trust me. Wild Pokemon only jump out when you go into tall grass, so we can just 
            run past the tall grass before any Pokemon sees us. If we can just keep dashing,
            we can get to Sandgem Town without running into wild Pokemon!"
            <br> <br>
            Barry took a few steps back. "Okay. Here goes!" He then started running.
            <br> <br>
            But before he could actually go into the tall grass, an old man's voice shouted 
            from behind us. "Hold it!" the voice said. 
            </p>
            <img src="Images/Series/Pokemon Platinum/PokePlat1/meet the prof.jpg" alt="Professor Rowan">
            <p>
            We turned around to see Professor Rowan. "You both don't seem to have any Pokemon 
            between you. Then why did you go into the tall grass?!" the professor scolded
            us. Barry was at a loss. The professor then went silent. Barry turned to me. 
            "Eris, this is Professor Rowan right? Then what is he doing here?"
            <br> <br>
            Professor Rowan thought for a short while, then looked at us. "You two. You truly
            love Pokemon, do you?" he asked. "Of course I do! That's why I wanted a starter
            Pokemon! Why else would I run through the tall grass to get to your lab?" I answered. 
            "Me too! I love Pokemon, too!" Barry replied.
            <br> <br>
            "I will ask you once again," the professor said. "You two truly love Pokemon, do
            you?" "What? You can ask a hundred times! The answer will never change! I love
            Pokemon!" Barry answered. "You do too, right?" he asked me. I nodded.
            <br> <br>
            This wasn't enough to convince the old man.
            "A pair of foolish kids who try to enter tall grass without any Pokemon? It
            worries me what people like that would do with Pokemon."
            <br> <br>
            Barry defended me. "Yeah, I know, but give my friend here a Pokemon. I
            mean, it was me who tried to run through the tall grass and all..." Barry
            said, nervously.
            <br> <br>
            "Well, very big of you! Fine, I will entrust you two with Pokemon! I apologize
            for putting you through that exercise." Professor Rowan said. Finally! 
            He trusts us! We're getting Pokemon! 
            The professor then cleared his throat. "But!" he said. "You must promise me that
            you will never recklessly endanger yourselves again."
            <br> <br>
            Professor Rowan then turned around. "Lucas! Give me the briefcase!"
            </p>
            <img src="Images/Series/Pokemon Platinum/PokePlat1/Hi Lucas.jpg" alt="Meet Lucas">
            <p>
            A boy around our age appeared from behind the professor, carrying a large, brown
            briefcase. "Nice work, Lucas. I'm going to entrust these two with their own Pokemon." 
            the professor said. Lucas was shocked. "What? But these Pokemon are crucial! You're 
            giving them away?"
            <br> <br>
            Professor Rowan promptly lectured him. "My boy, we live alongside Pokemon. There is
            a time where humans must meet Pokemon. There is a world that should be explored 
            together. For them, today is the time. The place, right here." 
            <br> <br>
            Professor Rowan then opened the briefcase. "Go on, choose a Pokemon!" he said in an
            encouraging tone. Barry was very excited. "Really? Professor! I can't believe it!
            I'm so happy now!" he said. 
            <br> <br>
            "Go on, Eris. Choose first. Hey, I'm practically a grown-up. I have to show some
            class here." Barry said. Really, Barry? You're the one who's always getting us 
            into all sorts of trouble! To be fair, it's not like I'm any better, but hey, at least
            I admit it.
            </p>
            <img src="Images/Series/Pokemon Platinum/PokePlat1/Briefcase.jpg" alt="Choose a starter!">
            <p>
            I took a look inside the briefcase. There were three Pokeballs. I took the Pokeballs
            and sent out the Pokemon inside all of them just to see how they look like.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
            Turtwig, the Grass-type Pokemon. Chimchar, the Fire-type Pokemon. And Piplup, the Water-type
            Pokemon. They're all cute! I had trouble picking which one. Maybe I'll have them all. Hee hee!
            But that means poor Barry won't get anything! So I'll pick just one.
            <br> <br>
