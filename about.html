            <h2>"What is this website?"</h2>
            <p>
            This is my personal website. It's a way to share my thoughts
            and document my Pokemon playthroughs.
            </p>
            <h2>"Then why did you choose to name this site Apocalypse Diaries?"</h2>
            <p>
            So it all started from when this site was going to be 
            <a href="/Apocalypse Diaries/testing.html">a joke conspiracy site</a>. 
            I then decided I wanted to document my Pokemon playthroughs and add my
            commentary in some way. So I changed up this site a little bit, and done.
            </p>
            <h2>"Who are you anyways?"</h2>
            <p>
            Oh, I'm just some guy with a little bit of HTML knowledge. Sorry if this site is a
            little... basic.
        </p>
        <h2>"No, I mean, what's your name?"</h2>
        <p>
        I'm Eris250, but you can just call me Eris.
        </p>
        <h2>"So, where are you from?"</h2>
        <p>
        I live in a metropolis area in Indonesia. So don't expect me to use inches and pounds or 
        be immediately familiar with certain brands.

        </div>
        <p>Anyways, have some cute looping GIFs.</p>
        <h2>"I liked those GIFs. Where can I get more of them?"</h2>
        <p class="bottom-of-page">
        They are called
        <a href="/Apocalypse Diaries/quby.html">Quby</a>
        or Well-Behaved Baby. They are a set of stickers created for 
        Wechat that ended up becoming more popular than expected.
