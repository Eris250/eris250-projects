        <h3>Part 2: A New Friend</h3>
        <p>
        I thought for a while over which Pokemon to pick. "So which one are you 
        going to pick?" Professor Rowan asked me. "I don't know! They're all cute."
        I answered. "It's okay, just pick the one that speaks to you the most."
        Professor Rowan replied.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        I finally went with Chimchar, the Fire-type starter. There's something
        about it that I find endearing. Chimchar looked energetic and ready to
        battle.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Now it's Barry's turn to choose. Unlike me, he made his choice right 
        away without hesitation. "Piplup, I choose you!"
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        "Listen up! The Pokemon you have been entrusted with are unfamiliar with 
        the world, much like you. If you have any problems, come to my lab in
        Sandgem Town." the Professor gave one last piece of advice. "And now, 
        we'll be on our way." 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Professor Rowan and Lucas then walked away into the tall grass. "Woah.
        Professor Rowan's actually really nice. On TV, he seems so stern and scary."
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Barry suddenly walked up close to me. "Heheh, Eris! We've both got Pokemon
        now. Now there's only one thing to do. We must battle!" he said, excitedly.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Barry sent out his Piplup. I wasn't prepared for this. We just became 
        trainers! On second thought, this would be a good way to see what Chimchar
        is capable of, so it's not that bad.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Chimchar's moves are Scratch and Leer. I told my Chimchar to Leer at his
        Piplup to intimidate it. Barry's Piplup growled cutely, hoping this would
        make my Chimchar go easy on it.
