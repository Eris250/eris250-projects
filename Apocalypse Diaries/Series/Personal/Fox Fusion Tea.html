        Fox's is a brand of hard candy that is commonly found at the local convenience stores.
        But one day, Fox's decided to expand its products and released Fox's Fusion Tea, its new
        brand of bagged tea, in 2 flavors: Mixed Berries and Lychee.

        <p>
        The product was, for some reason, only released in Indonesia, where
        it quickly became popular mainly because of how unexpected it is for Fox's to release 
        a tea product at all. A lot of people bought and reviewed it online. I haven't tried
        it yet, even long after the hype disappeared, so yesterday I decided to try it for myself.
        </p>

        <p>
        Since I didn't have Fox's Fusion Tea and was too lazy to go to the nearby convenience store to get
        one, I decided to substitute it with some Fox's 
        Mixed Berries oval candy instead. It took a while for the candy to fully dissolve in hot water. 
        Occasionally, I would stir it so the candy doesn't stick to the bottom of the glass.
        </p>

        <p>
        I added a little bit of water and one more piece of candy. The final result was a translucent, light pink liquid.
        Personally I think it tastes okay-ish? My mom tried it and liked it. Based on the taste, I think some
        people are going to like it, but it's certainly not for everyone. Anyways, if you want to recreate it,
        the exact recipe is: <br> - 110 ml hot water (approx.) <br> - 5 pieces of Fox's Oval Candy <br>
        You can add more water if you think it's too sweet, or more candy if you think it's not sweet enough.
        Or just try it with different Fox's flavours.
